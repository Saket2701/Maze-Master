# MazeMaster

MazeMaster is a JavaScript project that generates and solves mazes using HTML5 canvas.

## Overview

This project utilizes a maze generation algorithm and a solving algorithm to create and solve mazes dynamically. The maze is displayed on an HTML5 canvas, providing an interactive and visually appealing experience.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main parts:

1. **Maze Generation:**
   - The `Maze` class is responsible for creating and drawing the maze.
   - The `Cell` class represents each cell in the maze and handles wall creation, removal, and drawing.
   - The maze is generated using a recursive backtracking algorithm.

2. **Maze Solving:**
   - The solving algorithm is implemented in the `solveMaze` and `traverse` functions.
